Cleric_02_%%%
Spellcasting###
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric
spelis.#P#
Cantrips#$#
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice
from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.#P#
Preparing and Casting Spells#$#
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.#P#
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are
available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric
spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.#P#
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your
list of prepared spells.#P#
You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on
your list.#P#
Spellcasting Ability#$#
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric
spells. The power of your spells comes from your
devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom
whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.#P#
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.#P#
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.#P#
Ritual Casting#$#
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.#P#
Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use a holy symbol (see Equipment) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.#P#
Divine Domain###
Choose one domain related to your deity, such as
Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class
description, and each one provides examples of gods
associated with it. Your choice grants you domain
spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
level. It also grants you additional ways to use
Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd
level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th
levels.#P#
Domain Spells#$#
Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that
you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you
always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.#P#
If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on
the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric
spell for you.#P#
Channel Divinity###
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to
fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
domain. Some domains grant you additional effects
as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain
description.#P#
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect to create. You must then finish a short
or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.#P#
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving
throws. When you use such an effect from this class,
the DC equals your cleric Spell save DC.#P#
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th
level, you can use it three times between rests. When
you finish a short or long rest, you regain your
expended uses.#P#
Channel Divinity: Turn Undead#$#
As an action, you present your holy symbol and
speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead
that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes any damage.#P#
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to
move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It
also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect
that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
move, the creature can use the Dodge action.#P#
Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.#P#
Destroy Undead###
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the
creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating
is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
Destroy Undead table.#P#

Divine Intervention###
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use
your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and
roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or
lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes.
The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the
effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would
be appropriate.#P#
If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again
after you finish a long rest.#P#
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
automatically, no roll required.#P#
Life Domain###
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive
energy-one of the fundamental forces of the
universe-that sustains all life. The gods of life
promote vitality and health through healing the sick
and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving
away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any
non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain,
particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea,
Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander,
Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or
endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and
Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such
as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).#P#

Bonus Proficiency#$#
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain
proficiency with heavy armor.#P#
Disciple of Life#$#
Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are
more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level
or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the
creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 +
the spell's level.#P#
Channel Divinity: Preserve Life#$#
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel
Divinity to heal the badly injured.#P#
As an action, you present your holy symbol and
evoke healing energy that can restore a number of
hit points equal to five times your cleric level.
Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and
divide those hit points among them. This feature can
restore a creature to no more than half of its hit
point maximum. You can't use this feature on an
undead or a construct.#P#
Blessed Healer#$#
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st
level or higher that restores hit points to a creature
other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the
spell's level.#P#
Divine Strike#$#
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your
weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of
your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8
radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th
level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.#P#
Supreme Healing#$#
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll
one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell,
you instead use the highest number possible for
each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit
points to a creature, you restore 12.#P#
