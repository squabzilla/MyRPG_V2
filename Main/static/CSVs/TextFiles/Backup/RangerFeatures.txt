Ranger%%%%%
Nature's Hunter###
Beginning at 1st level, Rangers are in tune with
the magic of nature, and are supernaturally skilled
at both tracking and hunting down their targets. You
know the Hunter's Mark and Druidcraft cantrips.
Well Travelled###
Rangers typically have a history of travelling all
over the world (or at least studying it.) Choose one
of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus
is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
the chosen skill.
You can also speak, read, and write two additional
languages.
Fighting Style###
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting
as your specialty. Choose one of the following
options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more
than once, even if you later get to choose again.
Archery#$#
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with
ranged weapons.
Defense#$#
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to
AC.
Dueling#$#
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand
and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
damage rolls with that weapon.
Two-Weapon Fighting#$#
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can
add your ability modifier to the damage of the
second attack.
Spellcasting###
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to
use the magical essence of nature to cast spells,
much as a druid does.
Spell Slots#$#
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal
friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell
slot available, you can cast animal friendship using
either slot.
Spells Known of Ist Level and Higher#$#
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the ranger spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table
shows when you learn more ranger spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new
spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the ranger spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the ranger
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability#$#
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger
spells, since your magic draws on your attunement
to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.
Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use a druidic focus (see Equipment) as a
spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.
Ranger Archetype###
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive
to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and
15th level.
Primeval Awareness###
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and
expend one ranger spell slot to focus your
awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute
per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense
whether the following types of creatures are present
within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you
are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials,
dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This
feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or
number.
Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.
Extra Attack###
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead
of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your
turn.
Alert Hunter###
Beginning at 6th level, you have advantage on all 
Pereption checks, and can't be surprised.
In addition, when you cast the Hunter's Mark cantrip,
it now lasts for up to 8 hours.
Land's Stride###
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You
can also pass through nonmagical plants without
being slowed by them and without taking damage
from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar
hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
against plants that are magically created or
manipulated to impede movement, such those
created by the entangle spell.
Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try
to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid
surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall
and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to
Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain
there without moving or taking actions. Once you
move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
Vanish###
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as
a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be
tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to
leave a trail.
Feral Senses###
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help
you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a
creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn ºt
impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
You are also aware of the location of any invisible
creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the
creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't
blinded or deafened.
Foe Slayer###
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of
your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can
add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the
damage roll of an attack you make against one of
your favored enemies. You can choose to use this
feature before or after the roll, but before any effects
of the roll are applied.
Additional Fighting Style###
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from
the Fighting Style class feature. 
Additionally, when you cast Hunter's Mark, it now
lasts for up to 24 hours.
Hunter###
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting
your place as a bulwark between civilization and the
terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's
path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting
the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and
hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying
dragons.
Hunter's Prey#$#
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of
your choice.
<b>Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the
most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8
damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can
deal this extra damage only once per turn.
<b>Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature
within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack,
you can use your reaction to attack that creature
immediately after its attack, provided that you can
see the creature.
<b>Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when
you make a weapon attack, you can make another
attack with the same weapon against a different
creature that is within 5 feet of the original target
and within range of your weapon.
Defensive Tactics#$#
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of
your choice.
<b>Escape the Horde.</b> Opportunity attacks against
you are made with disadvantage.
<b>Multiattack Defense.</b> When a creature hits you
with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all
subsequent attacks made by that creature for the
rest of the turn.
<b>Steel Will.</b> You have advantage on saving throws
against being frightened.
Multiattack#$#
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
<b>Volley.</b> You can use your action to make a ranged
attack against any number of creatures within 10
feet of a point you can see within your weapon's
range. You must have ammunition for each target, as
normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each
target.
<b>Whirlwind Attack.</b> You can use your action to
make a melee attack against any number of
creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack
roll for each target.
Superior Hunter's Defense#$#
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features
of your choice.
<b>Evasion.</b> When you are subjected to an effect, such
as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell,
that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to
take only half damage, you instead take no damage if
you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
damage if you fail.
<b>Stand Against the Tide.</b> When a hostile creature
misses you with a melee attack, you can use your
reaction to force that creature to repeat the same
attack against another creature (other than itself) of
your choice.
<b>Uncanny Dodge.</b> When an attacker that you can
see hits you with an attack, you can use your
reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
