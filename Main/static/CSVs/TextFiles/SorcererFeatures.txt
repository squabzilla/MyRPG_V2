Spellcasting###
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you
with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its
origin, fuels your spells.#P#
Cantrips#$#
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice
from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional
sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
table.#P#
Spell Slots#$#
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.#P#
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell
burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level
spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using
either slot.#P#
Spells Known of Ist Level and Higher#$#
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
the sorcerer spell list.#P#
The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table
shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new
spell of 1st or 2nd level.#P#
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.#P#
Spellcasting Ability#$#
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your
sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies
on your ability to project your will into the world.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.#P#
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier.#P#
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier.#P#
Ritual Casting#$#
You can any sorcerer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag.#P#
Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus
for your sorcerer spells.#P#
Sorcerous Origin###
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the
source of your innate magical power, such as
Draconic Bloodline.#P#
Your choice grants you features when you choose
it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.#P#
Font of Magic###
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic
within yourself. This wellspring is represented by
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of
magical effects.#P#
Sorcery Points#$#
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you
reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points
column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have
more sorcery points than shown on the table for
your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when
you finish a long rest.#P#
Flexible Casting#$#
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional
spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional
sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your
sorcery points as you reach higher levels.#P#
<b>Creating Spell Slots.</b> You can transform
unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a
bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots
table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given
level. You can create spell slots no higher in level
than 5th.#P#
Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes
when you finish a long rest.#P#

<b>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</b> As a
bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell
slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the
slot's level.#P#
Metamagic###
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells
to suit your needs. You gain two of the following
Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another
one at 10th and 17th level.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.#P#
Careful Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to
make a saving throw, you can protect some of those
creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you
spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one creature). A chosen creature automatically
succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.#P#
Distant Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the
range of the spell.#P#
When you cast a spell that has a range of touch,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of
the spell 30 feet.#P#
Empowered Spell#$#
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice
up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).
You must use the new rolls.#P#
You can use Empowered Spell even if you have
already used a different Metamagic option during
the casting of the spell.#P#
Extended Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute
or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double
its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.#P#
Heightened Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make
a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3
sorcery points to give one target of the spell
disadvantage on its first saving throw made against
the spell.#P#
Quickened Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1
action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the
casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.#P#
Subtle Spell#$#
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point
to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.#P#
Twinned Spell#$#
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature
and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a
number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to
target a second creature in range with the same
spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).#P#
To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of
targeting more than one creature at the spell's
current level. For example, magic missile and
scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost is.#P#
Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.#P#
Sorcerous Restoration###
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points
whenever you finish a short rest.#P#
Dragon Ancestor#$#
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each
dragon is used by features you gain later.#P#
Draconic Ancestry$tt$
Dragon_::_Damage Type$tc$
Black_::_Acid$ti$
Blue_::_Lightning$ti$
Brass_::_Fire$ti$
Bronze_::_Lightning$ti$
Copper_::_Acid$ti$
Gold_::_Fire$ti$
Green_::_Poison$ti$
Red_::_Fire$ti$
Silver_::_Cold$ti$
White_::_Cold$ti$
You can speak, read, and write Draconic.
Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check
when interacting with dragons, your proficiency
bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.#P#
Draconic Resilience#$#
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st
level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and
increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in
this class.#P#
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a
thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't
wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
modifier.#P#
Elemental Affinity#$#
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals
damage of the type associated with your draconic
ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one
damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that
damage type for 1 hour.#P#
Dragon Wings#$#
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed
equal to your current speed. You can create these
wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until
you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.#P#
You can't manifest your wings while wearing
armor unless the armor is made to accommodate
them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.#P#
Draconic Presence#$#
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those
around you to become awestruck or frightened. As
an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on
this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your
choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until
you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a
concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts
its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or
frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A
creature that succeeds on this saving throw is
immune to your aura for 24 hours.#P#
