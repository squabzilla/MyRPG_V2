Warlock_10_%%%
Otherworldly Patron###
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an
otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the
Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed
at the end of the class description. Your choice
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.#P#
Pact Magic###
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on
you by your patron have given you facility with
spells.#P#
Cantrips#$#
You know two cantrips of your choice from the
warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.#P#
Spell Slots#$#
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you
have. The table also shows what the level of those
slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To
cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher,
you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a short or long
rest.#P#
For example, when you are 5th level, you have two
3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell
thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.#P#
Spells Known of Ist Level and Higher#$#
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your
choice from the warlock spell list.#P#
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table
shows when you learn more warlock spells of your
choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose
must be of a level no higher than what's shown in
the table's Slot Level column for your level. When
you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new
warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.#P#
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the warlock spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the warlock
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.#P#
Spellcasting Ability#$#
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your
warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Charisma modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.#P#
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier#P#
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier#P#
Ritual Casting#$#
You can any warlock spell you know as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag.#P#
Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus
for your warlock spells.#P#
Eldritch Invocations###
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed
eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden
knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical
ability.#P#
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of
your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at
the end of the class description. When you gain
certain warlock levels, you gain additional
invocations of your choice, as shown in the
Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.#P#
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class,
you can choose one of the invocations you know and
replace it with another invocation that you could
learn at that level.#P#
Pact Boon###
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the
following features of your choice.#P#
Pact of the Chain#$#
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a
ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number
of spells known.#P#
When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the
normal forms for your familiar or one of the
following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit,
or sprite.#P#
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you
can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your
familiar to make one attack of its own with its
reaction.#P#
Pact of the Blade#$#
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in
your empty hand. You can choose the form that this
melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are
proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon
counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming
resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
damage.#P#
Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5
feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also
disappears if you use this feature again, if you
dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you
die.#P#
You can transform one magic weapon into your
pact weapon by performing a special ritual while
you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over
the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a
short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon,
shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it
appears whenever you create your pact weapon
thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient
weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your
pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour
ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour
ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears
at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space
when the bond breaks.#P#
Pact of the Tome#$#
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of
Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three
cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't
be from the same list). While the book is on your
person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
don't count against your number of cantrips known.
If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they
are nonetheless warlock spells for you.#P#
If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform
a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from
your patron. This ceremony can be performed
during a short or long rest, and it destroys the
previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.#P#
Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.#P#
Mystic Arcanum###
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a
magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.#P#
You can cast your arcanum spell once without
expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest
before you can do so again.#P#
At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of
your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th
level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You
regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you
finish a long rest.#P#
Eldritch Master###
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of
mystical power while entreating your patron to
regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute
entreating your patron for aid to regain all your
expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.
Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you
must finish a long rest before you can do so again.#P#
Eldritch Invocations###
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must
meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at
the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level
prerequisite refers to your level in this class.#P#

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of
Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the
ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't
be from the same list). The spells appear in the book
and don't count against the number of spells you
know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can
cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the
spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them
by some other means. You can also cast a warlock
spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
On your adventures, you can add other ritual
spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such
a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level
is equal to or less than half your warlock level
(rounded up) and if you can spare the time to
transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the
transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp
for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.#P#

The Fiend###
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower
planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil,
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings
desire the corruption or destruction of all things,
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to
forge a pact include demon lords such as
Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils
such as Asmodeus, Dispater,
Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that
are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords
of the yugoloths.#P#

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.#P#
Fiendish Resilience#$#
