Druid_03_%%%
Druidic###
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You
can speak the language and use it to leave hidden
messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check but can't decipher it without
magic.#P#
Spellcasting###
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.#P#
Cantrips#$#
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice
from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.#P#
Preparing and Casting Spells#$#
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To
cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot
of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.#P#
You prepare the list of druid spells that are
available for you to cast, choosing from the druid
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid
spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots.#P#
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your
list of prepared spells.#P#
You can also change your list of prepared spells
when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of
druid spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
spell on your list.#P#
Spellcasting Ability#$#
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion
and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.#P#
<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.#P#
<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier.#P#
Ritual Casting#$#
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has
the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.#P#
Spellcasting Focus#$#
You can use a druidic focus (see Equipment) as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.#P#
Wild Shape###
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to
magically assume the shape of a beast that you have
seen before. You can use this feature twice. You
regain expended uses when you finish a short or
long rest.#P#
Your druid level determines the beasts you can
transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.
At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any
beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that
doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.#P#
Beast Shapes$tt$
Level_::_Max. CR_::_Limitations_::_Example$tc$
2nd_::_1/4_::_No flying or swimming speed_::_Wolf$ti$
4th_::_1/2_::_No flying speed_::_Crocodile$ti$
8th_::_1_::_-_::_Giant Eagle$ti$
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of
hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down).
You then revert to your normal form unless you
expend another use of this feature. You can revert to
your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on
your turn. You automatically revert if you fall
unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.#P#
While you are transformed, the following rules
apply:#P#
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.#B#
When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.#B#
You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.#B#
You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.#B#
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.#B#
Druid Circle###
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of
druids, such as the Circle of the Land. Your choice
grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th,
10th, and 14th level.#P#
Ability Score Improvement###
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.#P#
Timeless Body###
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you
wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10
years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.#P#
Beast Spells###
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your
druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild
Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal
components of a druid spell while in a beast shape,
but you aren't able to provide material components.#P#
Archdruid###
At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an
unlimited number of times.#P#
Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and
somatic components of your druid spells, as well as
any material components that lack a cost and aren't
consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both
your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild
Shape.#P#
Circle of the Land###
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and
sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites
through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet
within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to
whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest
members preside as the chief priests of communities
that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to
the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle,
your magic is influenced by the land where you were
initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.#P#
Bonus Cantrip#$#
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn
one additional druid cantrip of your choice.#P#
Natural Recovery#$#
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your
magical energy by sitting in meditation and
communing with nature. During a short rest, you
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your druid level (rounded up), and
none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't
use this feature again until you finish a long rest.#P#
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you
can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You
can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level
slots.#P#
Circle Spells#$#
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you
with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th,
and 9th level you gain access to circle spells
connected to the land where you became a druid.
Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest,
grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the
associated list of spells.#P#
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day. If you
gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the
druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell
for you.#P#

Land's Stride#$#
Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You
can also pass through nonmagical plants without
being slowed by them and without taking damage
from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar
hazard.#P#
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws
against plants that are magically created or
manipulated to impede movement, such those
created by the entangle spell.#P#
Nature's Ward#$#
When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or
frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune
to poison and disease.#P#
Nature's Sanctuary#$#
When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural
world sense your connection to nature and become
hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant
creature attacks you, that creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save
DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a
different target, or the attack automatically misses.
On a successful save, the creature is immune to this
effect for 24 hours.#P#
The creature is aware of this effect before it makes
its attack against you.#P#
