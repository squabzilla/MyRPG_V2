Create level 1 character of each class
attributes (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha) won't be included
    maybe add these if I have time, it won't be super hard?
class features, spells will be included
This means I'll be making a database of JUST level-1 features for initial version
(while I'm at it, I should make a level_one_spells.csv and import that one instead of all spells lol)

Only classes supportable at first: fighter, wizard
Fighter means we have to pick fighting style at lvl 1
Wizard means we have to pick spells at lvl 1

Left to do:
Actually fucking display the character sheet
Log in and save, load characters
-> loading a character can just set the values in the "new_pc = rpg_char_create()" value lol
-> considering I need code to display that as well, I can re-use the code to display both loaded and created characters this way
-> getting somewhere, shows up to class-features now
-> still need to make it prettier and add spells, but progress =D

-> you know what? Don't even have change-password in version to submit

Currently working on displaying spells, having spells show up and an accordion list of spells by level seems nice
Show attribute of spell as well. Don't do spell attack/save DC. They require proficiency bonus anyways and I'm not there.
Also a nice text-box filled with "spell-descriptions to come later"

TO-DO:
DONE
