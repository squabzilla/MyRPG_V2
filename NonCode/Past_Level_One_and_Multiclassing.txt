As characters level up:
I'll make a one-to-many table with:
user_id     class_id        class_level     subclass_id

every class they add is a new-entry in this database
subclass defaults to 0, changes when they get to a level with a subclass

when they level up a class, this table is referenced to determine what their next level gets them
(including figuring out if they have a level of the new class in the first place)

then their features/spells are updated
