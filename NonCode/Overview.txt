I have a lot of ideas for how I'd change a lot of aspects of D&D 5E,
to the point that my "houserules" for it would wind up being an entirely different game.

This idea is a very large undertaking, and CS principles teaches us to break down problems into smaller chunks.

The first goal will be to create my own database of spells, which I can then filter by various attributes.
To start:
Spells_Name_Database (1-to-1 relationship)
Spell_ID (unique, primary key), Spell_Name (Unique), Other-attributes_tbd_1, Other-attributes_tbd_2, etc.

Spell_Description_Database (1-to-1 relationship)
Spell_ID (unique, foreign-key reference Spells_Name_Database), Description (VERY LARGE amount of text)
Description in theory will be unique, but in practice, the description can have potentially hundreds of words
and thousands of characters, so we're not gonna spend the computational-power checking uniqueness.

Spell_Tags_Database (many-to-many relationship)
Spell_ID (NOT unique, foreign-key reference Spells_Name_Database)
